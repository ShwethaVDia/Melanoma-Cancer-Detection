# Project Name
> To build a CNN based model which can accurately detect melanoma. Melanoma is a type of cancer that can be deadly if not detected early. It accounts for 75% of skin cancer deaths. A solution that can evaluate images and alert dermatologists about the presence of melanoma has the potential to reduce a lot of manual effort needed in diagnosis.

## General Information
- A multiclass classification model using a custom convolutional neural network in TensorFlow. 
- CNN based model which can accurately detect melanoma.
- A solution that can evaluate images and alert dermatologists about the presence of melanoma has the potential to reduce a lot of manual effort needed in diagnosis.
- The dataset consists of 2357 images of malignant and benign oncological diseases, which were formed from the International Skin Imaging Collaboration (ISIC).

<!-- You don't have to answer all the questions - just the ones relevant to your project. -->

## Conclusions
- A CNN model, which can accurately detect 9 classes present in the dataset.
- Accuracy on training data has increased after using Augmentor library.
- The model improved by tuning the parameter.
- Model verfitting solved by adding more neurons or more layers.
